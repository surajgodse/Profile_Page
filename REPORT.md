## Summary and Reflection

For a profile page, I made a Flutter app that has five primary sections: the profile header, about me, talents, projects, and education. I kept user information, project information, and educational data in distinct classes. With unique widgets for every part, the application has a modular architecture. The application efficiently displays personal information in a neat and eye-catching design.


For this profile app, I had fun designing the layout and making the unique widgets. The primary challenge was incorporating seamless horizontal scrolling for several parts. Before beginning this project, I should have learned more about Flutter's state management.
